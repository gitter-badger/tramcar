TODO:

- Should not be able to add duplicate categories, companies, etc. (need to figure out how to handle bookshelf validations)
- Disallow write actions (add category, add company, post job, etc.) when not logged in
- Sessions should persist after a server restart

- Send Tweet when job has been posted
- Indicate in job listings if you have clicked on a job (change link colour or similar?)

Long-term:

- Investigate alternate to markdown for formatting of job description and application information (pure HTML?)

Done:
